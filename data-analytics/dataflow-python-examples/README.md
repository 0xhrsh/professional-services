# Dataflow using python
This repo contains several examples of the Dataflow python API.  The examples
are solutions to common use cases we see in the field.

The solutions below become more complex as we incorporate more dataflow
features.  

## Ingesting data into BigQuery
Ingest from a file into BigQuery, with no transformations.

## Transforming data
Transform data from file and load into BigQuery.

## Joining data
Read a dataset from a file, and another from BigQuery.  Load the joined
results into BigQuery.

## Data lake to data mart
Join data from two different datasets in BigQuery, applying transformations to
the joined dataset before uploading to BigQuery.
